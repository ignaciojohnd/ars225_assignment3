Overview
Connection Ceased is an audiovisual piece using photos of power lines generated from my real photos of power lines with accompanying generated poetry.

Process Explanation
The pictures in my dataset were taken in Setauket off Pasture Road, and Stony Brook. They include power lines around that area. I then trained a Stable Diffusion model on these pictures and used it to generate pictures of power lines. I organized these pictures into a video, overlaid them with a film filter that goes from color to black and white, with generated text based off “The Waste Land” by T. S. Eliot.

Why This Collection
I’ve always been fascinated by the infrastructure of power lines and how they transmit all that data and electricity and connect us to each other. I find their tall, imposing aesthetic to be symbolic of their role and significance in connecting our society. I wanted to make an art piece using this concept as a metaphor for lost connection. I thought Eliot’s work was fitting for generating text based off because it’s about ruin, brokenness, and loss.

Outcome
Connection Ceased is about a decaying sense of connection represented through power lines that lose their color and become less tangible. It is about our connections with people, tracing the love and history, yet it comes to an unavoidable end. There is a feeling of ‘memento mori’ and that we must value our connections while they are still there. The aesthetic of this piece is inspired by the suburban and southern gothic aesthetic of decay, isolation, and lingering hopelessness.
